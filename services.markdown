<h2>Web Development</h2>

I provide web development services on a contract basis. I can develop single-shot web applications, maintain existing web applications, or even provide bug fixes.

<h2>Simple Web Hosting</h2>

I provide low-cost web hosting for small-scale websites. You'll receive your own Plesk login for easy management of your hosting package, as well as unlimited email accounts for your own domain.

You'll also receive personal technical support to keep your website up and running.
