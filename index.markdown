Hello! I'm Philip Tomlinson, a front-end web developer and owner of Coderover.
</p>

I provide front-end web development expertise on a freelance basis. I usually work from my home office for my clients based in the UK, and on-site for my clients in Zagreb, Croatia, where I live.

I specialise in front-end web development and am well-versed in the languages of <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

My most recent experience of frameworks includes <strong>Blazor</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, and I'm proficient with tools such as <strong>Gulp</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>.

I've worked with tonnes of other frameworks throughout the years, so check out <a href="{{ "/assets/documents/philip-tomlinson-profile-v1.pdf" | relative_url }}" target="_blank">my profile</a> and <a href="/services.html">services</a> to read more about what I can do.

If you'd like to hire me for your web application project, or you just want to start a discussion and get to know me, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a> to get in touch!
