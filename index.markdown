<h2>By Philip Tomlinson</h2>

I'm Philip Tomlinson - owner of Coderover. I'm a front-end web developer that works on a freelance and remote basis from my own office.

I specialise in languages and frameworks such as <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Blazor</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>Gulp</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and many more.
